We have a patent number.

After cross-referencing the mechanical design of our unit with the USPTO patent database, we found a match: **U.S. Patent 2,733,032**, filed in 1956 and titled "Christmas Tree Rotator."

## The Surprise

Here's the thing — the patent describes a rotating platform mechanism, but it makes **no mention** of the electric motor, the music box, or the integrated electrical outlets for tree lights. Our unit has all of those features.

This means one of two things:

1. The additional features were added in a later revision (possibly covered by a separate patent)
2. SpinCraft enhanced the design beyond what was patented

Either way, the patent gives us a concrete starting point for the investigation.

## What We're Looking For

- Any continuation or related patents filed after 1956
- Patent assignment records that might name SpinCraft or the Ulrich family
- Engineering drawings or correspondence related to this filing

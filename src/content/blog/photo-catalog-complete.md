The full catalog of photographs and 3D renders is now complete.

We spent the last several weeks carefully documenting the Christmas Tree Turner from every angle — the base unit, the remote controller, the music mechanism, the underside, the label, and all the small details that might help someone identify the manufacturer or date of production.

## What's Included

- **High-resolution photographs** of every component and surface
- **3D renders** created from careful measurements of the original unit
- **Detail shots** of the label, wiring, mechanical components, and construction techniques

All of this is now available on the site for anyone who wants to help with the research. If you're a historian, collector, or just someone with a sharp eye — take a look and let us know if anything stands out.

## Why This Matters

Physical evidence degrades over time. By documenting everything now, we ensure that researchers years from now will still have access to detailed visual records of this unit, even if the original hardware deteriorates further.

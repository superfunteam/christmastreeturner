It started the way most family mysteries do — with a thing in the garage nobody could explain.

For as long as anyone in our family can remember, we've had this *full-size mechanical Christmas tree turner*. Not a tabletop novelty. Not a lazy Susan with a motor. A purpose-built, belt-driven machine designed to slowly rotate a real, decorated Christmas tree. Cast metal. Solid construction. No brand markings we could find.

## What We Know

The turner has been in the family since at least the 1960s. It was passed down through generations without much explanation — just "the tree thing" that came out every December.

Here's what we've pieced together so far:

- **Construction**: Heavy cast base, belt-driven motor, designed for full-size trees
- **Origin**: Possibly manufactured in Milwaukee, based on early leads
- **Era**: Mid-century, likely 1950s–1960s based on materials and design
- **Manufacturer**: Unknown — and that's the whole point of this site

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about a Christmas decoration. It's about a piece of American manufacturing history that seems to have almost no documentation. Who made these? How many exist? Were they a commercial product or a small-batch curiosity?

## How You Can Help

If you've seen one of these, know someone who has, or have any leads on the manufacturer — we want to hear from you. Every verified lead earns a bounty donated to a teacher or school.

The search is on.

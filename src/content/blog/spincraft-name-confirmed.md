Big news — we can now confirm the manufacturer name.

After a careful re-inspection of the original unit, we found a faded but legible label on the underside of the base. It reads **SpinCraft** along with "Milwaukee, Wis." and "Heirloom Christmas Tree Spinner."

## What This Means

This confirms the family story that the unit was manufactured by a company called SpinCraft, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The label also gives us the official product name: **Heirloom Christmas Tree Spinner**.

We had been searching under various names — "Christmas Tree Turner," "tree rotator," "tree spinner" — but now we have the exact branding to search for in historical records, catalogs, and advertisements.

## Next Steps

- Search Milwaukee business directories from the 1950s for SpinCraft
- Check USPTO records for any trademarks filed under the SpinCraft name
- Reach out to Milwaukee County Historical Society for manufacturing records

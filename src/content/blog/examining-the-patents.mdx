We now have two patents connected to the Christmas Tree Turner. Comparing them side by side reveals an interesting evolution in the design.

## The Original: Patent 2,733,032

The first patent was filed in 1956 and covers the basic rotating platform mechanism.

<DocumentCard id="us-patent-2733032" />

What's striking about this patent is what it *doesn't* include. There's no mention of electrical outlets for tree lights, no music box, and no remote control. It's a pure mechanical rotator — elegant but minimal.

## The Follow-Up: Patent 2,847,175

Two years later, a second patent was filed. This one is assigned directly to **Spincraft, Inc.** and covers a "Revolving Stand."

<DocumentCard id="us-patent-2847175" />

This patent *does* mention illumination, integrated lighting, and a music mechanism. It's essentially the full feature set we see in our family's unit.

## What This Tells Us

The two-year gap between patents suggests an iterative development process. Someone — possibly at SpinCraft — took the basic rotator concept and enhanced it significantly. The question is: who drove those enhancements? Was it an in-house engineering team? An outside inventor who licensed the design? Or could it have been a family member?

These are the questions we're still trying to answer. If you have access to patent assignment records, corporate filings from 1950s Milwaukee, or any documentation from SpinCraft — [get in touch](/index.astro#contact).

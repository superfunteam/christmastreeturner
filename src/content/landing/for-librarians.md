# For Librarians & Archivists

## This Mystery Lives in Your World

We're a Texas family trying to trace the origins of a full-size mechanical Christmas tree turner—the "Heirloom Christmas Tree Spinner" made by SpinCraft in Milwaukee, WI (Patent No. 2733032). Our grandfather allegedly "invented" it. We need help from the people who know where things are actually buried.

## Why Librarians Specifically

This isn't a Google problem. The answers live in the analog world:

- Microfilm city directories
- Industrial trade publications from the 1950s-60s
- Milwaukee-area business records
- Christmas merchandise catalogs
- Newspaper archives that aren't digitized

You know the collections. You know what survived and where it's hiding.

## What to Look For

- **SpinCraft** business listings (Milwaukee, 1950-1965)
- Milwaukee city directories showing SpinCraft or related manufacturers
- Trade publications mentioning Christmas tree turners/spinners
- Sears, Montgomery Ward, or other catalog mentions
- Newspaper advertisements for tree turners
- **Ulrich family** connections to Milwaukee manufacturing

## Archives Worth Checking

- Milwaukee Public Library (City Directories, business records)
- Wisconsin Historical Society
- Milwaukee County Historical Society
- Trade publication archives
- Patent and trademark libraries

# For Teachers

## A Family Hunt Honoring Four Decades in the Classroom

My mom taught for over 40 years. She believed in curiosity, persistence, and helping people discover answers. This hunt to trace our family's vintage Christmas Tree Turner is exactly the kind of mystery she'd love — and every bounty we pay honors her legacy by supporting teachers and schools.

## How This Benefits Educators

Every verified lead that moves us closer to the origin earns a donation to a teacher or school of the finder's choosing. That means:

- You could be the researcher who solves it
- Or a colleague might nominate you as the recipient
- Either way, teachers win

## How You Can Help

**Share with the right people:**
- History buffs, antique collectors, librarians
- Local historians or museum curators
- Alumni networks with long memories

**Use it as a teaching moment:**
- Older students can practice archival research
- It's real detective work with real stakes

**Connect us:**
- Know someone who might know someone? Introductions matter.

## Spread the Word

Sometimes the best contribution is just telling the right person this hunt exists.

# For Bounty Hunters

## The Challenge

We've hit a wall. AI tools scraped the internet dry and came up empty. This isn't a keyboard mystery anymore — it's a boots-on-the-ground detective case.

A Texas family is hunting the origins of their full-size mechanical Christmas Tree Turner (SpinCraft, Milwaukee, Patent 2733032). It exists. It works. But the company, the manufacturer, the distribution chain — all ghosts.

If you're the type who digs through archives, haunts estate sales, or knows how to work a microfiche machine, we need you.

## Active Bounties

- **$250** — Print advertisement (magazine, newspaper, or catalog with publication date)
- **$250** — Patent documentation (filing notes, diagrams, correspondence tied to Patent 2733032)
- **$250** — Working unit (any surviving example with photo/video evidence)
- **$500** — Verified family connection (documents tying Ulrich family to manufacturing/distribution)
- **$500** — Verified family photo (unseen photo of Ulrich family member with unit in commercial context)
- **$50** — Find a sponsor (refer someone who commits to a sponsorship tier)

## The Rules

Bounties are paid as donations to a teacher or school of your choice. Not cash to you. Evidence must be verified before payout.

## How to Claim

Email **clark@superfun.team** with your evidence, or use the contact form on this site.

Good hunting.
